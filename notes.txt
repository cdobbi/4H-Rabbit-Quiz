Classes
RabbitQuestion with properties like text, options, correctIndex, maybe a fact.
RabbitQuiz holding an array of RabbitQuestion, tracking score, and exposing methods like start().

Recursion
Inside RabbitQuiz, write a function askQuestion(index: number) that calls itself with index + 1 until it reaches the end of the list.

Asynchronous Functions
Use Node’s readline/promises to ask questions with await to pause for user input.

Exceptions
When parsing answers, if the user enters something invalid (not a number, out of range), throw an error and catch it to show a friendly message while retrying.

Lists
The question bank is a simple array of RabbitQuestion instances.

Terminal Output
Use console.log for prompts, helpful hints, and final score.
